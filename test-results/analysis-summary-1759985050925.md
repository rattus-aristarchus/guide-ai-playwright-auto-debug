2. A/B Testing: Leads to a page for A/B testing examples.
3. Add/Remove Elements: Leads to a page for adding and removing elements.
4. Basic Auth: Leads to a page requiring basic authentication with username and password "admin".
5. Broken Images: Leads to a page with broken images.
6. Challenging DOM: Leads to a page with a challenging DOM structure.
7. Checkboxes: Leads to a page with checkboxes.
8. Context Menu: Leads to a page with a context menu.
9. Digest Authentication: Leads to a page requiring digest authentication with username and password "admin".
10. Disappearing Elements: Leads to a page with elements that disappear and reappear.
11. Drag and Drop: Leads to a page for drag and drop examples.
